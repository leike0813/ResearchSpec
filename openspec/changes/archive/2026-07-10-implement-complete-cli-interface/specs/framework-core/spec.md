## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Minimal ResearchSpec CLI

ResearchSpec SHALL expose a local `researchspec` CLI whose public command
registry covers workspace initialization, inspection, generated tool delivery,
derived context artifacts, explicit decisions, and resolved-item archiving.

#### Scenario: CLI displays help

- **WHEN** a user runs `researchspec --help`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL display the complete public command registry

#### Scenario: CLI displays version

- **WHEN** a user runs `researchspec --version`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL display the package version
- **AND** the command SHALL NOT require an initialized workspace

#### Scenario: Unsupported command fails clearly

- **WHEN** a user runs an unsupported command
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL return a usage-class error
- **AND** the message SHALL direct the user to help output

### Requirement: Workspace Initialization

ResearchSpec SHALL create or safely extend the documented `researchspec/`
workspace without inventing research content or overwriting user contracts.

#### Scenario: Dry-run initialization reports planned files

- **WHEN** a user runs `researchspec init --tools none --dry-run`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL report the workspace files and directories it would
  create, update, delete, or skip
- **AND** it SHALL NOT write files

#### Scenario: Initialize workspace without agent tools

- **WHEN** a user runs `researchspec init --tools none`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL create the stable workspace skeleton and local config
- **AND** it SHALL NOT generate adapter files

#### Scenario: Existing workspace is extended safely

- **GIVEN** a `researchspec/` workspace already exists
- **WHEN** a user reruns `researchspec init`
- **THEN** the CLI SHALL preserve existing research contracts
- **AND** it SHALL add only missing metadata or safely managed generated files

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Workspace Metadata Sources Of Truth

ResearchSpec SHALL separate user-selected workspace configuration from generated
installation ownership evidence.

#### Scenario: Metadata is created without replacing contracts

- **WHEN** an older valid workspace lacks config or installation manifest files
- **THEN** initialization or update SHALL create the missing metadata
- **AND** existing research contracts SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement: Shared Write Planning

All public writing commands SHALL use one preflighted write-plan model with
explicit ownership and overwrite policy.

#### Scenario: User contracts are protected

- **WHEN** a planned operation targets an existing user-owned research contract
- **THEN** neither `--force` nor `--yes` SHALL silently overwrite it

#### Scenario: Authoritative records are committed last

- **WHEN** a multi-file operation succeeds
- **THEN** its installation manifest or decision ledger entry SHALL be committed
  after dependent file writes

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: First Slice Boundaries

**Reason**: The first framework slice is complete and this change deliberately
implements the remaining documented public CLI and generated tool delivery.

**Migration**: Use the complete public command registry. ARSU converter,
upstream synchronization, semantic workflow execution, and runtime LLM calls
remain outside the public CLI.
