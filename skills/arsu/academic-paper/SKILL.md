## ResearchSpec Contract Preflight

Before running this ARSU-derived skill, locate the project `researchspec/`
workspace. Read `specs/workflow.yaml` and `runs/current/state.yaml` first,
then load only the contracts and artifact references needed for the current
skill, stage, phase, or mode.

Use `runs/current/artifact-registry.json` to read prior artifacts. Call
`researchspec status --json` and treat its `profile.mode`, canonical action
frontier, and each selected action descriptor as authority. Request details only
for selectors returned by status or a transaction's `next_selectors`; do not
reconstruct work order, stages, Gates, or transitions from this Skill text.

At a new or materially changed route, a newly ready work item, or an explicit
specialist request, evaluate optional reviewed domain assistance with
`researchspec plugin list --summary --json`, then inspect only plausible domains
with `researchspec plugin show <domain-id> --summary --json`. Semantic matching
is the Agent's judgment, not CLI authority. If one or more specific uninstalled
Skills would materially help, propose at most three domains in one batch and
show the matching Skills, purpose, and direct/resolved Skill counts. Keep this
consent separate from route confirmation. After the confirmed core Start,
dry-run the exact plugin batch with `--summary --json`, show its domain
versions, resolved Skills, projected tools, write summary, and
`plan_sha256`, obtain explicit confirmation, then execute with
`--expected-plan-sha256 <sha256> --yes --summary --json`.

When an installed, available, projected plugin Skill materially assists the
current work, invoke it natively if the host has loaded it; otherwise request
`researchspec plugin instructions <skill-id> --json` and follow that exact
hash-bound entry. Give the helper only the current task, necessary inputs,
expected response, and forbidden ResearchSpec authority writes. Its result is
working material returned to this ARSU producer for review and integration; it
does not become the candidate producer, workflow dependency, subflow, work item,
Gate, Decision, transition, or receipt. Installation consent does not authorize
scripts, dependencies, network, credentials, services, or sensitive-data use.
If discovery, consent, installation, activation, or invocation is unavailable,
continue the same core work without the plugin. A declined suggestion is not a
Decision and should not be repeated in the current conversation unless the
research need materially changes.

For literature work, the active ARSU producer may use an installed
Zotero task Skill as a bounded provider after a just-in-time readiness check.
Adapter results remain working evidence and cannot directly modify ResearchSpec
specs, state, artifact registry, Gates, Decisions, transitions, or receipts.
Private or library-bound work pauses when readiness fails. Acquisition is
candidate-only without a current bounded authorization, and Curation always
requires a separate request.

The packaged `academic-pipeline/scripts/adapters/zotero.py` path is separate: it
reads only a user-supplied Better BibTeX JSON export, requires a user-provided
Python 3.11+ environment with PyYAML, and is not a live Zotero fact source.

### Shared Runtime Boundaries

Use the selected action descriptor's command, execution policy, input schema,
current basis, and policy-derived `execution_requirements`. `direct` actions
run in one CLI transaction; `human_confirmed` Start requires the displayed
route confirmation; and `plan_bound` Gate, Decision, and patch-Advance actions
require an exact preview followed by execution with the matching action basis,
plan hash, and confirmation. Never infer an expected hash flag: use the
descriptor and preview returned for that action.

After a durable transaction, use its `next_selectors` and targeted
`instructions` reads to continue. Refresh full status when route availability,
profile, or a material working context may have changed; it is not required after
every mechanical step. Never invent paths, artifact types, provenance, runtime
writes, or direct edits to state, registries, receipts, or JSONL ledgers.

For a formal Gate, use `researchspec-verify` to produce evidence-linked findings,
show the proposed verdict and consequences, and obtain explicit human confirmation.
On challenge, reverify before offering an override. Start confirmation and
`--yes` are not Gate confirmation. A failed reverification may advance only after
`researchspec-decide` records an override bound to that Gate event and receipt.

### Adaptive Runtime (`profile.mode: adaptive`)

After a confirmed external `subflow:<template>` Start, follow only ready
`obligation:<instance>/<id>`, `gate:<instance>/<id>`,
`completion:<instance>/<id>`, `case-action:<id>`, `patch:<id>`, or
`change:<id>` selectors. An obligation descriptor defines the hard evidence
boundary and output path. Within those hard dependencies, ARSU may reorder,
parallelize, retry, replace, or rework semantic tasks.

Use `researchspec submit obligation:<instance>/<id>` with the descriptor's
action schema: record a provisional attempt, pause it with a reason, request a
waiver or not-applicable resolution, or accept validated durable evidence. Only
`accept_evidence` satisfies the obligation and registers its evidence; ordinary
working material remains provisional. Resolve a requested waiver or
not-applicable case through its returned `case-action:` Decision. Submit a
ready formal Gate only after its evidence is accepted and the user confirms the
Verify verdict. When all required obligations and Gates are complete, use the
returned `completion:` selector with `researchspec advance`.

Adaptive work has no `work:` or `transition:` graph, parent-child stage
frontier, automatic submission policy, or Material Passport import. Handle
high-impact semantic changes and draft patches only through their returned
`change:` or `patch:` case actions and the corresponding Propose, Decide, or
Advance transaction.

### Strict Runtime (`profile.mode: strict`)

Follow the profile graph through external `subflow:<template>`, delegated
`subflow:<parent>/<node>`, scoped `work:<instance>/<node>`,
`gate:<instance>/<node>`, and `transition:<instance>/<node>` selectors.
Work instructions define the candidate, dependency, validation, and submission
policy. A trusted automatic work item may use direct hash-bound artifact Submit;
manual work requires the preview and explicit confirmation stated by its
descriptor. Registration is mechanical and is not academic approval.

Start a child only when its parent-scoped selector is in the frontier. Parent
confirmation authorizes that exact mechanical Start; it never confirms a Gate or
branch. Use Verify and a human-confirmed Gate submission for every formal Gate.
When one transition is authorized, request its instructions and execute its
receipt-bound Advance; route branch choices and overrides through
`researchspec-decide`. Revision rounds have no inferred maximum: after
re-review, follow only the next selector returned by the strict frontier.

An ARS Material Passport is never runtime truth. Strict
`academic-pipeline:mid-entry` Start may import it as external evidence only;
the current adaptive runtime does not support Passport import.

This generated contract integration block uses profile `researchspec-preflight-v9` for
`academic-paper`. The active workspace profile and CLI action descriptors choose
the applicable runtime protocol.

# Academic Paper — Academic Paper Writing Agent Team

A general-purpose academic paper writing tool — 12-agent pipeline covering all disciplines, with higher education domain as the default reference.

**v2.5** adds two writing quality features:
- **Style Calibration** (intake Step 10, optional) — Provide 3+ past papers and the pipeline learns your writing voice (sentence rhythm, vocabulary preferences, citation integration style). Applied as a soft guide during drafting; discipline conventions always take priority. See `references/shared/style_calibration_protocol.md`.
- **Writing Quality Check** (`references/writing_quality_check.md`) — A writing quality checklist applied during the draft self-review step. Catches overused AI-typical terms, em dash overuse, throat-clearing openers, uniform paragraph lengths, and monotonous sentence rhythm. These are good writing rules, not detection evasion.

> **Routing discipline (v3.9.2):** see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` "Routing Discipline (v3.9.2)" + `references/shared/references/intent_clarification_protocol.md` for cross-skill routing rules. This skill assumes routing has already settled — ambiguous cross-phase materials should have been clarified upstream.

## Quick Start

**Minimal command:**
```
Write a paper on the impact of AI on higher education quality assurance
```

```
Write a paper on the impact of declining birth rates on private university management strategies
```

**Execution flow:**
1. Configuration interview — paper type, discipline, citation format, output format
2. Literature search — systematic search strategy, source screening
3. Architecture design — paper structure, outline, word count allocation
4. Argumentation construction — claim-evidence chains, logical flow
5. Full-text drafting — section-by-section draft, register adjustment
6. Citation compliance + bilingual abstract (parallel)
7. Peer review — five-dimension scoring, revision suggestions
8. Output formatting — LaTeX/DOCX (via Pandoc)/PDF/Markdown

## Orchestration Workflow (8 Phases)

```
Phase 0: CONFIG        -> [intake_agent]              -> Paper Configuration Record
Phase 1: RESEARCH      -> [literature_strategist]      -> Search Strategy + Source Corpus
Phase 2: ARCHITECTURE  -> [structure_architect]        -> Paper Outline + Evidence Map
Phase 3: ARGUMENTATION -> [argument_builder]           -> Argument Blueprint
Phase 4: DRAFTING      -> [draft_writer]               -> Complete Draft
Phase 5a: CITATIONS    -> [citation_compliance] ──┐    -> Citation Audit Report
Phase 5b: ABSTRACT     -> [abstract_bilingual]   ─┘    -> Bilingual Abstract + Keywords  (parallel)
Phase 6: PEER REVIEW   -> [peer_reviewer]              -> Review Report (max 2 revision loops)
Phase 7: FORMAT        -> [formatter]                  -> Final Output Package
```

> See `references/workflow_phase_details.md` for detailed per-phase agent behavior and output descriptions.

### Checkpoint Rules

1. ⚠️ **IRON RULE**: User must confirm Paper Configuration Record before proceeding to Phase 1
2. **Phase 2 -> 3**: User must approve outline (can request restructuring)
3. ⚠️ **IRON RULE**: Max 2 revision loops; unresolved items -> "Acknowledged Limitations"
4. **Peer Review** Critical-severity issues block progression to Phase 7
5. User can skip Phase 1 (literature) if providing own sources

> **v3.4.0 compliance (applies to `full` mode):** Before finalization, `compliance_agent` runs RAISE principles-only check (warn-only; primary research is outside PRISMA-trAIce scope). Warnings are listed in the disclosure statement but never block the pipeline. See `references/shared/raise_framework.md §Scope disclaimer`.

## Phase-by-phase Invocation Contract (v3.9.2)

academic-paper pipeline runs in 8 phases (Phase 0 intake → 7 formatting). Two invocation modes:

<!--rs:STATE-001-->
ResearchSpec owns the active run through `researchspec/runs/current/state.yaml`. Read the current subflow instances, frontier, Gate ledger and Decision ledger before dispatch. An ARS Material Passport may be imported as non-authoritative evidence through `material_passport_import`, but it never replaces current state or grants a transition.
<!--/rs:STATE-001-->

<!--rs:IO-005-->
In phase-by-phase mode, the literature strategist, structure architect, draft
writer, citation compliance, bilingual abstract, peer review, and formatting
roles may write only the outputs declared by the selected work item. They may
read registered upstream artifacts required by that work. The argument-building
and visualization roles may span their documented stages only when the current
frontier instructions explicitly select that work; one invocation does not
authorize work in another stage. The generator-evaluator contract continues to
constrain the draft-writer and peer-review call pairs within their selected
work.

Phase-by-phase routing requires an explicit user signal. Ambiguous cross-stage
material must be clarified before dispatch. The configured graph in
`researchspec/specs/workflow.yaml`, the frontier in
`researchspec/runs/current/state.yaml`, and registered inputs in
`researchspec/runs/current/artifact-registry.json` define the permitted read and
write boundary.
<!--/rs:IO-005-->

## v3.6.6 Generator-Evaluator Contract Protocol

<!--rs:REVIEW-010-->
> This block defines the `academic-paper full` generator/evaluator split. Resolve
> the frozen `writer_full` and `evaluator_full` contract JSON plus every Phase
> 4a/4b and 6a/6b artifact through
> `researchspec/runs/current/artifact-registry.json`. Preserve the four-call
> paper-blind/paper-visible separation, mode exclusions, baseline fields, system
> prompt text, lint rules, and writer/evaluator role distinction described
> below. Register each accepted phase output before it is consumed downstream;
> submit lint, disagreement, or failure-condition results to the responsible gate
> helper for `researchspec/runs/current/gate-ledger.jsonl`. The orchestrator may
> instantiate allowed runtime fields but must not mutate the frozen contract or
> write runtime records directly.
<!--/rs:REVIEW-010-->
>
> **Applies to `academic-paper full` mode only.** Nine non-full modes (`plan`, `outline-only`, `revision`, `revision-coach`, `abstract-only`, `lit-review`, `format-convert`, `citation-check`, `disclosure`) are byte-equivalent across v3.6.5 → v3.6.6 and do not invoke this protocol. (The later-added `rebuttal-audit` mode is likewise non-full and does not invoke this protocol.) Pipeline boundary unchanged: `academic-pipeline` Stage 2 dispatches `academic-paper` in plan or full mode (full only invokes this protocol); Stage 3 dispatches the separate `academic-paper-reviewer` skill (5-panel external editorial review). The in-pair Phase 6 evaluator under this protocol and the Stage 3 reviewer are different review layers — see design doc §5.1 audit conclusion 2.

### Overview

v3.6.6 splits Phase 4 (writer drafting) and Phase 6 (in-pair evaluator review) into paper-blind / paper-visible call pairs gated by the `writer_full` and `evaluator_full` contracts. The split mirrors `references/cross-skill/academic-paper-reviewer/references/sprint_contract_protocol.md` (the v3.6.2 reviewer pattern) but adapts it for single-agent generator modes that have no panel and (for the writer) no scoring_plan.

The load-bearing mechanism is the **physical separation of calls**: writer Phase 4a never sees the runtime drafting artefacts; evaluator Phase 6a never sees the writer Phase 4b draft. This destroys the "read the paper, then rationalise the standard" drift path on the in-pair self-quality gate.

### Four-call structure

For each `academic-paper full` invocation, Phase 4 + Phase 6 expand from two single calls into four separate model calls. Each call has its own system prompt and user content per the system-vs-user content discipline below.

1. **Phase 4a — writer paper-blind pre-commitment.**
   - System prompt: `### Phase 4a — Writer paper-blind pre-commitment` sub-section in `agents/draft_writer_agent.md` § "v3.6.6 Generator-Evaluator Contract Protocol".
   - User content: `writer_full` contract JSON + paper metadata only (`title`, `field`, `word_count`).
   - Output: `## Acceptance Criteria Paraphrase` section + terminal `[PRE-COMMITMENT-ACKNOWLEDGED]` tag.
   - Lint: 3 structural checks (see § "Phase 4a / 6a output lint" below).
2. **Phase 4b — writer paper-visible drafting + self-scoring.**
   - System prompt: `### Phase 4b — Writer paper-visible drafting + self-scoring` sub-section in the same agent file.
   - User content: `writer_full` contract JSON (re-injected) + Phase 4a output wrapped in `<phase4a_output>...</phase4a_output>` data delimiter + upstream drafting artefacts (Paper Configuration Record, Paper Outline, Argument Blueprint, Annotated Bibliography, optional Style Profile, optional Knowledge Isolation Directive).
   - Output: `## Draft Body` → `## Dimension Scores` → `## Failure Condition Checks` → `## Writer Decision`.
   - Lint: 4 structural checks (see § "Phase 4b / 6b output lint" below).
3. **Phase 6a — evaluator paper-blind pre-commitment.**
   - System prompt: `### Phase 6a — Evaluator paper-blind pre-commitment` sub-section in `agents/peer_reviewer_agent.md` § "v3.6.6 Generator-Evaluator Contract Protocol".
   - User content: `evaluator_full` contract JSON + paper metadata + the writer's most recent `<phase4a_output>` (the writer artefact the evaluator must verify per `disagreement_handling.pre_commitment_check_protocol.check_writer_artifact`).
   - Output: `## Contract Paraphrase` + `## Scoring Plan` (per-dimension `dimension_id` / `what_to_look_for` / `what_triggers_block` / `what_triggers_warn`) + terminal `[PRE-COMMITMENT-ACKNOWLEDGED]` tag.
   - Lint: 5 structural checks.
4. **Phase 6b — evaluator paper-visible scoring + decision.**
   - System prompt: `### Phase 6b — Evaluator paper-visible scoring + decision` sub-section in the same agent file.
   - User content: `evaluator_full` contract JSON (re-injected) + Phase 6a output wrapped in `<phase6a_output>...</phase6a_output>` + the writer's `<phase4a_output>` (unconditional per `pre_commitment_check_protocol.check_writer_artifact`) + the writer Phase 4b draft (the artefact under review).
   - Output: `## Dimension Scores` → `## Failure Condition Checks` → `## Review Body` → `## Evaluator Decision`.
   - Lint: 5 structural checks.

### System prompt vs user content discipline

Mirrors `sprint_contract_protocol.md` §2 reviewer pattern verbatim:

- **System prompt carries invariant policy text only**: the phase sub-section instructions from the agent file's `## v3.6.6 Generator-Evaluator Contract Protocol` block, the lint description, and the phase-boundary tag conventions.
- **User content carries the contract JSON (re-injected per call) plus the runtime inputs allowed at that phase**: paper metadata, `<phase4a_output>` / `<phase6a_output>` delimiter blocks, upstream drafting artefacts, the paper draft.

All dynamic LLM output (Phase Na runtime emissions, paper content) lives in user content via data delimiters, never in the system prompt. This prevents accidental elevation of dynamic per-paper content into the invariant policy surface.

### Schema field name vs runtime emission distinction

`pre_commitment_artifacts` (snake_case, backticks) is the schema field name in `assets/shared/sprint_contract.schema.json` — a configuration declaration in the frozen contract baseline. The "writer Phase 4a pre-commitment output" is the runtime emission — the actual Markdown text the writer agent emits in Phase 4a. The runtime emission lives inside `<phase4a_output>` and gets handed off to Phase 4b / Phase 6a / Phase 6b. Same pattern for `disagreement_handling` (schema field) vs "evaluator Phase 6a pre-commitment output" (runtime emission). Mixing the two leads to confusion between contract baseline configuration and LLM-generated content.

### Phase 4a / 6a output lint

Mode-specific structural check counts, per `sprint_contract_protocol.md` §4 enumeration convention:

- **Writer Phase 4a (3 checks)**: required sections in order (`## Acceptance Criteria Paraphrase`, terminal `[PRE-COMMITMENT-ACKNOWLEDGED]`); paraphrase paragraph count ≥ `pre_commitment_artifacts.acceptance_criteria_paraphrase.minimum_dimensions`; Phase 4a content references contract JSON + paper metadata only. **No `## Scoring Plan` section** — `writer_full` carries no scoring_plan.
- **Evaluator Phase 6a (5 checks)**: required sections in order (`## Contract Paraphrase`, `## Scoring Plan`, terminal `[PRE-COMMITMENT-ACKNOWLEDGED]`); paraphrase paragraph count ≥ `disagreement_handling.paraphrase_minimum_dimensions`; one `### <Dn>: <name>` subsection per acceptance dimension; each scoring_plan subsection contains `disagreement_handling.scoring_plan.per_dimension_criteria` four-field shape (`dimension_id`, `what_to_look_for`, `what_triggers_block`, `what_triggers_warn`); Phase 6a content references contract JSON + paper metadata + the writer's `<phase4a_output>` only (no full draft / paper content).

Retry semantics: lint failure on the first attempt → retry once with the specific lint gap hinted in the system prompt; second failure → mark this role unusable per § "Single-agent generator unusable handling" below.

### Phase 4b / 6b output lint

- **Writer Phase 4b (4 checks)**: required sections in order — `## Draft Body`, `## Dimension Scores`, `## Failure Condition Checks`, `## Writer Decision`; Dimension Scores one-to-one across the seven writer dimensions D1–D7 (per `assets/shared/contracts/writer/full.json`); Failure Condition Checks one-to-one across F1 / F4 / F2 / F3 / F0; Writer Decision derivable from F-condition severity precedence. **No multi-dissent retry** (writer has no scoring_plan to dissent against). **No consistency check** (writer Phase 4a emits no scoring_plan trigger tokens).
- **Evaluator Phase 6b (5 checks)**: required sections in order — `## Dimension Scores`, `## Failure Condition Checks`, `## Review Body`, `## Evaluator Decision`; Dimension Scores one-to-one across the five evaluator dimensions D1–D5 (per `assets/shared/contracts/evaluator/full.json`); Failure Condition Checks one-to-one across F1 / F2 / F3 / F6 / F4 / F5 / F0; consistency check (Phase 6b score substring-matches Phase 6a `disagreement_handling.scoring_plan.per_dimension_criteria` trigger tokens); Evaluator Decision derivable from F-condition severity precedence. **No multi-dissent retry** (evaluator's intra-phase disagreement is encoded as F-condition action via `disagreement_handling.disagreement_resolution`, not as a retry trigger).

Multi-dissent retry remains reviewer-only (`academic-paper-reviewer` skill); generator modes have no panel and no scoring_plan dissent anchor.

Lint count summary across the three modes:

| Phase | Reviewer (zero-touch) | Writer | Evaluator |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 / 4a / 6a | 5 | 3 | 5 |
| Phase 2 / 4b / 6b | 6 | 4 | 5 |

### Single-agent generator unusable handling

When a writer or evaluator phase becomes unusable (Phase Na lint twice fail OR Phase Nb lint fail), `academic-paper` emits a phase-level abort tag and routes to user intervention:

- **Writer Phase 4 unusable** → `[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED: role=writer, contract=<id>, reason=<lint_failure_kind>]` → abort `academic-paper` Phase 4 → user intervention decides retry / fallback / regression to Phase 3 (Argument Blueprint).
- **Evaluator Phase 6 unusable** → `[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED: role=evaluator, contract=<id>, reason=<lint_failure_kind>]` → abort `academic-paper` Phase 6 → user intervention decides retry / fallback / regression to Phase 5 (Drafting completion).

`[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED]` does **not** constitute a valid Phase 6b emission and cannot enter Stage 3 reviewer dispatch. Two valid Stage 3 entry paths exist (per design doc §5.1):

- **Standard path**: evaluator Phase 6b emits F0 `evaluator_decision=accept` or F4 `evaluator_decision=accept_with_dissent_note`.
- **Exceptional path**: evaluator Phase 6b emits F5 `evaluator_decision=flag_for_reviewer_stage` after the in-pair revision loop exhausts at round 2 with mandatory-dimension block recurring.

`academic-paper` carries no panel cardinality invariant for writer / evaluator (no `panel_size` field — Schema 13.1 §3.3.5 reviewer-conditional). There is no `[PANEL-SHRUNK]` analogue at the generator side; `[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED]` is phase-level abort.

**Operational monitor**: track `[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED]` rate over the first three months of v3.6.6 deployment. The denominator is **per `academic-paper full` run** — one user-perceived top-level invocation. The 5% threshold is `(runs_with_any_abort) / (total_runs)`. If the rate exceeds 5%, v3.6.7 introduces graceful-degradation fallback (see § "Known limitations" below).

### Cross-session resume scope

The v3.6.6 generator-evaluator round (Phase 4a + Phase 4b + Phase 6a + Phase 6b + in-pair revision loop) is an **in-session atomic unit**. Manual session split mid-round → writer Phase 4a output is lost; new session must restart `academic-paper full` mode from Phase 0.

The v3.6.3 `ARS_PASSPORT_RESET=1` `reset_boundary[]` mechanism (per `references/cross-skill/academic-pipeline/references/passport_as_reset_boundary.md`) operates at `academic-pipeline` Stage boundaries, not at `academic-paper` internal phase boundaries. `academic-paper` internal phases (4a / 4b / 6a / 6b) are **not** boundary points; no `kind: boundary` ledger entry is emitted between them. v3.6.7+ may introduce `pre_commitment_history[]` to persist writer Phase 4a artefacts across sessions if operational data warrants — see § "Known limitations" below.

## Known limitations

- **No graceful-degradation fallback in v3.6.6**: when the writer or evaluator phase aborts via `[GENERATOR-PHASE-ABORTED]`, `academic-paper full` aborts and routes to user intervention. v3.6.7 may introduce a fallback that degrades the affected phase to v3.6.5 single-call behaviour and logs the degradation. v3.6.6 ships with abort-only behaviour. See § "Single-agent generator unusable handling" above for the operational 5% / three-month monitor.
- **No cross-session resume mid-round**: the four-phase generator-evaluator round is an in-session atomic unit. Manual session split mid-round loses the writer Phase 4a artefact and forces restart from Phase 0. v3.6.7+ may introduce a `pre_commitment_history[]` ledger entry in Schema 9 to persist the writer Phase 4a artefact across session boundaries; v3.6.6 does not implement.
- **In-pair Phase 6 evaluator vs `academic-paper-reviewer` external review**: the in-pair `peer_reviewer_agent` (Phase 6 evaluator with the v3.6.6 contract gate) and the standalone `academic-paper-reviewer` skill (Stage 3 5-panel external editorial review) serve different review layers and remain documented as known technical debt per design doc §1 known limitations. Routing / merge decisions are deferred to v3.7.x.

## Operational Modes (11 Modes)

See `references/mode_selection_guide.md` for details.

| Mode | Trigger | Agents | Output |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| `full` | "Write a paper" | All 9 (+ 11 if quantitative) | Complete paper draft (with figures if applicable) |
| `outline-only` | "Paper outline" | 1->2->3 | Detailed outline + evidence map |
| `revision` | "Revise paper" | 8->5->6 | Patch document + deterministically applied revised draft + apply report (#390; revision log via `templates/revision_tracking_template.md`) |
| `abstract-only` | "Write abstract" | 1->7 | Bilingual abstract + keywords |
| `lit-review` | "Literature review" | 1->2 | Annotated bibliography + synthesis |
| `format-convert` | "Convert to LaTeX" / "Convert citations to [format]" | 9 only | Formatted document; includes citation format conversion (APA 7 / Chicago / MLA / IEEE / Vancouver) |

| `plan` | "guide my paper" / "help me plan my paper" | 1->10->3->4 | Chapter Plan + INSIGHT Collection |
| `revision-coach` | "parse reviews" / "revision roadmap" / "I got reviewer comments" / "should we push back" / "conference rebuttal" / "grant panel response" | 12 only | Revision Roadmap + optional Tracking Template + Response Letter Skeleton (covers pushback/disagreement posture + journal / conference / grant-panel / transfer-after-review scopes) |
| **`disclosure`** (v3.2) | **"AI disclosure for Nature" / "generate AI usage statement"** | **9 only** | **Venue-specific AI-usage disclosure paragraph(s) + placement instructions** |
| **`rebuttal-audit`** | **"audit my response" / "check my rebuttal" / "did I miss any reviewer comment"** (requires BOTH reviewer comments AND an existing rebuttal draft) | **12 only (parse-only)** | **Rebuttal QA report: per-comment coverage + gaps + risk flags.

### Quick Mode Selection Guide

| Your Situation | Recommended Mode | Spectrum |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Starting from scratch with a clear RQ | `full` | balanced |
| Need help planning before writing | `plan` | originality |
| Just need an outline | `outline-only` | balanced |
| Have a draft, received review feedback | `revision` | fidelity |
| Have unstructured reviewer comments | `revision-coach` | balanced |
| Just need an abstract | `abstract-only` | fidelity |
| Need to check/fix citations | `citation-check` | fidelity |
| Need to convert format (LaTeX, DOCX) or citation style | `format-convert` | fidelity |
| Want a systematic literature review paper | `lit-review` | fidelity |
| Need a venue-specific AI-usage disclosure statement for submission | `disclosure` | fidelity |
| Have a written rebuttal draft to QA against reviewer comments | `rebuttal-audit` | fidelity |

**Spectrum** (v3.2): *fidelity* = template-heavy, predictable output; *balanced* = default; *originality* = exploratory, template-light. See `references/shared/mode_spectrum.md` for the full cross-skill spectrum table.

Not sure? Start with `plan` — it will guide you step by step. `disclosure` is a finishing step — run it after the paper is drafted, targeting the venue you plan to submit to.

## Rebuttal-Audit Mode

`rebuttal-audit` evaluates an author's **existing** rebuttal / response-to-reviewers draft for coverage, tone, and evidence. It is advisory QA — it does **not** write or rewrite the response.

**Input gate (routing):** activate `rebuttal-audit` only when the user supplies BOTH (a) the reviewer comments / decision letter AND (b) an existing rebuttal/response draft to evaluate. If only (a) is present (no draft yet), route to `revision-coach` (which *generates* a response skeleton). If intent is ambiguous, clarify rather than guess.

**What it produces:**
- Per-comment coverage table — every reviewer concern marked `addressed` / `partially` / `missing` in the draft.
- Gap list — concerns the draft fails to answer.
- Risk flags — tone too combative, claims made without evidence, or a response that misreads the reviewer's actual point.
- Improvement suggestions (advisory).

<!--rs:REVIEW-011-->
**IRON RULE — advisory integrity boundary:** standalone `rebuttal-audit` may
reuse comment parsing, but it remains outside Stage 4.5 integrity and produces
only an advisory response-letter QA artifact. Return the coverage table, gap
list, tone/evidence risks, and suggestions for registration in
`researchspec/runs/current/artifact-registry.json`. It MUST NOT emit verified
commitment status, apply a draft patch, mark a package `ready_to_submit`, or
write ResearchSpec registries or ledgers. If its findings imply a change in
accepted response strategy or claim scope, propose that change and wait for a
human decision recorded through
`researchspec/runs/current/decision-ledger.jsonl`; the audit itself never
certifies acceptance.
<!--/rs:REVIEW-011-->

**Boundary vs `re-review`:** `academic-paper-reviewer`'s `re-review` mode verifies the **revised manuscript** (did the author's claimed changes actually appear in the paper) and runs inside the pipeline. `rebuttal-audit` verifies the **response letter itself** (does the rebuttal cover every comment, is its tone/evidence sound) and runs standalone, advisory. Different artifacts, different layers.

## Revision Mode Patch Protocol (#390)

<!--rs:PATCH-001-->
In `academic-paper` revision mode, `draft_writer_agent` does not re-emit the
complete manuscript. The round uses the following bounded patch workflow:

1. **Prepare the base artifact.** Resolve the current manuscript id and hash
   through `researchspec/runs/current/artifact-registry.json`. The deterministic
   preparation helper assigns stable block markers where missing and emits a
   refreshed block-manifest artifact. Nothing may rewrite the manuscript between
   manifest creation and apply.
2. **Emit the patch.** The writer creates
   `researchspec/draft-patches/<patch-id>.json` with target artifact id/hash,
   block preconditions copied from the manifest, closed operations, and non-empty
   roadmap traceability. The writer does not re-emit the full manuscript, apply
   operations, or update runtime records.
3. **Apply deterministically.** The apply helper validates the entire patch
   fail-closed before writing. A stale hash or invalid operation leaves the base
   byte-identical. Success creates a new manuscript artifact and separate apply
   report containing changed/fresh block ids, structural flags, operations, and
   `preserved_ratio`; both are returned for runtime registration and are required
   re-review inputs.
4. **Escalate structural work, never silently fall back.** Heading rewrites,
   section-count changes, or touched ratio above the accepted threshold stop for
   a human choice. Return the choice to the decision runtime for
   `researchspec/runs/current/decision-ledger.jsonl`. Only confirmed full
   re-emission may regenerate the whole manuscript; mark it
   `mode: full_reemission_escalated`, create fresh block ids afterward, and
   invalidate patches tied to the prior hash.

Orchestrated and phase-by-phase runs use the same preparation and apply helpers.
Patch mode guarantees byte preservation only for untouched blocks; it does not
guarantee the quality of edited text. Finalizer and gate checks run on the new
registered artifact, and any failure is returned to the responsible helper
rather than written directly to a ledger.

This patch protocol does not apply to the `academic-paper full` in-pair Phase
6→4 loop. That loop must continue to emit the complete `## Draft Body` required
by the Phase 4b contract; it must not emit or apply a revision patch.

## Plan Mode: Chapter-by-Chapter Guided Planning

Socratic mode that guides users through paper planning one chapter at a time. Builds a complete Paper Blueprint through structured dialogue.

> See `references/plan_mode_protocol.md` for the full chapter-by-chapter dialogue flow and Paper Blueprint structure.

## Handoff Protocol: deep-research -> academic-paper

`intake_agent` automatically detects deep-research materials (RQ Brief / Bibliography / Synthesis / INSIGHT Collection) and skips redundant steps. See `references/cross-skill/deep-research/SKILL.md` Handoff Protocol for the complete handoff material format.

---

## Failure Paths

See `references/failure_paths.md` for details. Quick reference:

| Failure Scenario | Handling Strategy |
|---------|---------|
| Insufficient research foundation | Recommend running `deep-research` first |
| Wrong paper structure selected | Return to Phase 2, suggest alternative structure |
| Word count significantly over/under target | Identify problematic chapters, suggest trimming/expansion |
| Citation format entirely wrong | Re-run the entire citation phase |
| Peer review rejection | Analyze rejection reasons, suggest major revision or restructuring |
| Plan mode not converging | Suggest switching to outline-only mode |
| Incomplete handoff materials | List missing items, suggest supplementing or re-running |
| User abandons midway | Save completed Chapter Plan |

## Phase 0: Configuration Interview

See `agents/intake_agent.md` for the complete field definitions of the Phase 0 configuration interview. The interview covers 9 core items: paper type, discipline, target journal, citation format, output format, language, abstract, word count, and existing materials — plus co-authors, funding, optional style calibration, the domain evidence profile (Step 12), and the citation-verification level (Step 13, #392: mark only by default / strict opt-in, seeding `terminal_policies.citation_existence`). Outputs a Paper Configuration Record, awaiting user confirmation.

## Anti-Patterns

Explicit prohibitions to prevent common failure modes:

| # | Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Correct Behavior |
|---|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **AI-typical overused terms** | "delve into", "crucial", "it is important to note" = instant AI detection | Use discipline-specific vocabulary; see `references/writing_quality_check.md` |
| 2 | **Em dash abuse** | More than 2 em dashes per page signals AI writing | Use parentheses, commas, or restructure the sentence |
| 3 | **Throat-clearing openers** | "In this section, we will discuss..." adds no information | Start with the claim or finding directly |
| 4 | **Uniform paragraph lengths** | Every paragraph is 4-5 sentences = monotonous AI rhythm | Vary paragraph length naturally (2-8 sentences) |
| 5 | **⚠️ IRON RULE: Fabricated citations** | Inventing plausible-sounding references that don't exist | Every citation must be verified via DOI or WebSearch; see `references/cross-skill/academic-pipeline/agents/integrity_verification_agent.md` |
| 6 | **Sycophantic revision** | Accepting all reviewer feedback without critical evaluation | Use REVIEWER_DISAGREE status when reviewer is wrong; justify with evidence |
| 7 | **Scope creep during revision** | Adding unrequested sections/analyses to "improve" the paper | Revision addresses reviewer concerns only; new content requires explicit user approval |
| 8 | **Ignoring failure paths** | Continuing despite desk-reject signals or fatal methodology flaws | Check `references/failure_paths.md`; invoke F11 Desk-Reject Recovery when triggered |

## Quality Standards

### Writing Quality
1. **Every claim must have a citation** or be supported by the paper's own data
2. **Zero citation orphans** — in-text citations <-> reference list must perfectly match
3. **Consistent register** — academic tone appropriate for the discipline
4. **Logical flow** — clear transitions between paragraphs and sections
5. **Word count compliance** — within +/-10% of target

### Bilingual Abstract Quality
6. **Independent writing** — zh-TW and EN abstracts are independently composed, NOT mechanical translations
7. **Structural alignment** — both abstracts cover the same key points in the same order
8. **Keywords** — 5-7 per language, reflecting the paper's core concepts
9. **Word count** — EN: 150-300 words; zh-TW: 300-500 characters

### Citation Quality
10. **Format compliance** — 100% adherence to selected citation style
11. ⚠️ IRON RULE: **DOI inclusion** — every source with a DOI must include it; every citation must be verified via DOI or WebSearch
12. **Currency** — flag sources older than 10 years (unless seminal works)
13. **Self-citation ratio** — flag if >15%

### Peer Review
14. **Five dimensions** — Originality (20%), Methodological Rigor (25%), Evidence Sufficiency (25%), Argument Coherence (15%), Writing Quality (15%)
15. **Actionable feedback** — every criticism must include a specific suggestion
16. **Max 2 revision rounds** — unresolved items become Acknowledged Limitations

### Mandatory Inclusions
⚠️ **IRON RULE**: Every paper MUST include: Data Availability Statement, Ethics Declaration, Author Contributions (CRediT), Conflict of Interest Statement, Funding Acknowledgment.
17. **AI disclosure statement** — every paper must include a statement on AI tool usage
