## Claim Intent Manifest Emission (v3.8)

Pre-commitment baseline read by the v3.8 `claim_ref_alignment_audit_agent`. External motivation: Zhao et al. arXiv:2605.07723 (2026-05) §1 + Li et al. RubricEM arXiv:2605.10899 (Borrows 1 + 2). Spec: `docs/design/2026-05-15-issue-103-claim-alignment-audit-spec.md` §3.2 + §4 step 5. Schema: `shared/contracts/passport/claim_intent_manifest.schema.json` (the source of truth — this section narrates only the emission protocol).

Before drafting the first prose block of the synthesis output, append ONE `claim_intent_manifests[]` entry to the Material Passport listing the substantive claims the synthesis intends to make and any author-declared "must not" rules. The audit agent reads this baseline to run the three-set diff (intended ∩ emitted ∩ supported) per spec §4 step 5 (D6).

Canonical example (single manifest with one MNC and one claim-level NC):

```json
{
  "manifest_version": "1.0",
  "manifest_id": "M-2026-05-15T09:55:00Z-a1b2",
  "emitted_by": "synthesis_agent",
  "emitted_at": "2026-05-15T09:55:00Z",
  "claims": [
    {
      "claim_id": "C-001",
      "claim_text": "Preprint hallucinations survive into the published record at 85.3%.",
      "intended_evidence_kind": "empirical",
      "planned_refs": ["zhao2026"],
      "negative_constraints": [
        {"constraint_id": "NC-C001-1", "rule": "No causal claims about LLM authorship."}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "manifest_negative_constraints": [
    {"constraint_id": "MNC-1", "rule": "No unqualified causal language across the synthesis."}
  ]
}
```

Three firm rules:

- **R-CIM-A (one-shot pre-commitment):** Emit exactly ONE manifest entry per agent invocation, BEFORE the first prose block. No later mutation, no append, no re-emission within the same invocation. Drafting that introduces a claim not in the manifest produces a `claim_drifts[]` entry with `drift_kind=EMITTED_NOT_INTENDED` downstream — that detection is the design intent (drift is surfaced, not silenced). The manifest is the pre-commitment artifact the audit diffs against; rewriting it mid-draft would hide the signal.
- **R-CIM-B (no audit responsibility):** The synthesis agent emits manifests; it does NOT detect drift, re-judge supported / unsupported, or read other manifests. The §"Manifest cross-reference (D6)" set-diff lives in `claim_ref_alignment_audit_agent.md`. Mirrors the v3.6.7 partial-inversion discipline: narrative-side emits, audit-side reads.
- **R-CIM-C (no frontmatter reading):** Generate `claim_text`, `intended_evidence_kind`, `planned_refs`, and any `negative_constraints[].rule` values from the corpus + prompt context already provided. You MUST NOT read entry frontmatter to discover candidate claims — the same partial-inversion rule that gates anchor selection in v3.7.3 R-L3-1-C. The orchestrator allocates a fresh `manifest_id` per invocation (M-INV-4); never copy a `manifest_id` from a sibling manifest.

The agent's job still ends at emission. The audit agent reads the manifest downstream and runs the manifest set-diff, constraint-set assembly (§4 step 3), and drift / constraint-violation routing. Manifest-side mutation by this agent would erase the pre-commitment signal the audit depends on.

### Experiment-backed claims (#260)

When a claim is backed by the scholar's OWN experiment (not a literature citation), emit an optional `planned_experiment_ids[]` array on that claim listing the `experiment_provenance[].experiment_id` values it relies on:

```json
{
  "claim_id": "C-002",
  "claim_text": "Removing head pruning raises macro-F1 by 4.2 points on the held-out set.",
  "intended_evidence_kind": "empirical",
  "planned_refs": [],
  "planned_experiment_ids": ["exp-ablation-A"]
}
```

- **R-CIM-D (experiment emission):** Emit `planned_experiment_ids` ONLY when an experiment in the passport's `experiment_provenance[]` backs the claim. It is **optional-absent** — omit it entirely on literature-only / definitional / theoretical / normative claims (never emit an empty array; `minItems` is 1). The values are passport-local `experiment_id`s frozen at Stage 1 intake — reference them exactly as the scholar entered them; do NOT invent ids or rename. A claim carrying `planned_experiment_ids` MUST have `intended_evidence_kind: "empirical"` (EP-INV-3); an experiment is a source of empirical evidence, not a new evidence kind (there is NO `experimental` value — D2). **Mixed evidence is allowed:** a claim may carry BOTH `planned_refs` (literature) AND `planned_experiment_ids` (own experiment) — both back the empirical claim, and the gate audits each path. You do NOT compute the experiment alignment verdict (that is the integrity gate's `experiment_alignment_results[]`, #260); you only pre-commit the join.
